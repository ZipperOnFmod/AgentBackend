Agent Backend is a Momentum/Lawin fork with a BUNCH of extra things added for people to use, dont need credits, dont need to say your using it. Just star the repo and use it. Just know this version of the backend is 90% skidded! The privated one is discontinued for ZFN aswell so it could go public. Estella is better then the private one was so yk!
